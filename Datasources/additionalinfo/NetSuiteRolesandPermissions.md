## Role Creation and Modification in NetSuite

Sesame Software recommends, where it is possible, to modify an existing NetSuite role vs. creation of a role for RJWarehouse use. The process of creating a role from scratch with the many permissions you may or may not need can be a time sink. Using an existing role and verifying/adding permissions required is a quicker way to get your data replication up and running.

With a few exceptions any existing role can be utilized, however the following must be true:
   1. Not an Administrator-Level role.
      1. Note: A user may be an Administrator in addition to a secondary role for RJWarehouse but that secondary role must not be an admin-based role.
   2. Must have been created in the  **Center Type - Classic Center**. 
      1. Note: If the role is anything other than the Classic Center, you must use a different base role as the Center Type is set at role creation and cannot be changed.

#### Role Creation ####

1. Using an Administrator level account, log into NetSuite Instance.
2. Use global search for Manage Roles. 
3. In the dropdown results, click Page: Manage Roles
   1. Click New Role
   2. General Section
      1. NAME (*Recommended Name: ```RJWarehouse Role```*)
      2. ID suggest (*One string, use underscores instead of spaces; Recommended ID: ```rjwarehouse_customrole```*)
      3. CENTER TYPE
         1. REQUIRED - Classic Center
      4. EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIONS
         1. Set to (none - no default)
      5. DO NOT RESTRICT EMPLOYEE FIELDS
         1. Tick box 
      6. Subsidiary Restrictions Section
         1. Accessible Subsidiaries
            1. Click radial button for All
      7. Authentication Section
         1. Verify TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED is set to Not Required.

An existing role must have the Center Type, Employee Restrictions, Subsidiary Restriction and Authentication settings as above. Verify the following options are ***not*** checked: ```CORE ADMINISTRATION PERMISSIONS```, ```SINGLE SIGN-ON ONLY```, ```WEB SERVICES ONLY ROLE``` and ```RESTRICT THIS ROLE BY DEVICE ID```.

Optional but recommended: Re-name the existing role to indicate that it is being utilized by RJWarehouse in addition to its other functions to locate it in the future easily.

Once your role is created or you have your existing role which conforms to the requirements set above, save the role and then add the permissions for the data you need replicated.
#### NetSuite Permissions

Permissions may be configured for a role in NetSuite under **Setup &rarr; Users/Roles &rarr; Mange Roles**. The only permission additions/removals required by RJWarehouse are in the following Required and Access Violation sections. All other permissions are technically optional but will be required to replicate the individual objects they are related to. For example, if you are attempting to replicate the object Sales Order, you will need the permission for Sales Order but you may also need permissions for any related lists and Sales Order-adjacent objects (i.e.; Customer Payment, Account, etc).

Please see this Oracle Document: [NetSuite Users & Roles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_N284861.html) for more information on permissions.

Permissions
1. Using an Admin level account, log into the NetSuite instance.
2. Navigate to Setup &rarr; Users/Roles &rarr; Mange Roles
3. Find the role you are altering in the list.
4. Click edit
5. Find the necessary permission in the Permissions section tabs in the dropdown at the bottom of the page. There are 5 tabs of permissions: Transactions, Reports, Lists, Setup, and Custom Record.
6. Click add. 
   1. If you're adding a lot of permissions, save periodcally and navigate back to the 
7. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for any permissions you need.
8. Click save.

You can find information about removing objects from the RJWarehouse job that you don't have or don't wish to grant permission for in the [Advanced Configuration Properties](../rjwarehouseconfig2.md).

#### Required Permissions
Note: Most of the following permissions fall under the Permissions &rarr; Setup section for a role. All permissions from the Required section are necessary for the function of RJWarehouse

#### Other Permissions

Our Other Permissions section is a compilation of commonly used objects and useful data replications permissions. Please be aware that it is not possible for us to provide an exhaustive list of permissions as NetSuite adds support for new entities and permissions with each version.

Note: Most permissions outside of the Setup tab (Transactions, Reports, Lists) can be set for view-only to limit access if required. 

If you are receiving permission errors during a run for objects you know you have the permission for, setting to FULL or EDIT can sometimes be the issue.
