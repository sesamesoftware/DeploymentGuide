4. Navigate to **Setup&rarr;Integration&rarr;Manage Integrations**.
5. Create a new integration and select Token-Based Authentication. When the integration is created, the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret displayed will map directly to the OAuthClientId and OAuthClientSecret connection properties in RJWarehouse. Save the Application ID and the keys to the document where you saved the Account ID.

6. Create a token role by navigating to **Setup&rarr;User/Roles&rarr;Manage Roles** and either create a new role for RJWarehouse to use or edit an existing role with the required configuration and permissions
   1. See [Role Configuration](../../images/netsuitepermissions.md) for more information on the requirements for roles and permissions.

7. Add the role to a user under **Lists&rarr;Employees&rarr;Employees**. Select to edit an employee and add the new token role under **Access&rarr;Roles**.

9. Navigate to **Setup&rarr;User/Roles&rarr;Access Tokens** and create a new access token. Select the application name as the integration that was created earlier, and the same user and role that were updated in the previous steps.
